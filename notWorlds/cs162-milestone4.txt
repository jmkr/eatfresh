====================

For milestone 4 we completed tasks 5 - 7 from our project plan and also 
created a rought draft for our final project report. You can now commit child
world changes back to the parent world using "World.commit()", update the
child with changes from the parent using "World.update()", and test whether the
values in two worlds are equal using "World1 = World2".

To compile our interpreter, use the following command:

fsc syntax.scala interpreter.scala

We have included a couple more test cases that should be run like this:

scala notWorlds worldsTestX.not

Each input file has a corresponding output file

worldsTest3.not - Shows committing a child world back into its parent
worldsTest4.not - Shows updating a child world with changes in its parent
worldsTest5.not - Shows both committing and updating worlds
worldsTest6.not - Shows testing equality of two worlds
