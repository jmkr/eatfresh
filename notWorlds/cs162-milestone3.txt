====================

(See cs162-projectplan-updated.txt for our update project plan. It now includes
deliverable dates and minor syntax changes)

For milestone 3 we completed the first four tasks from our project plan. The current
world can be referenced using 'thisWorld', a world can be sprouted using
worldVar.sprout(), and arbitrary code can be executed inside of a world using 
'within worldVar { Term }'.

To compile our interpreter, use the following command:

fsc syntax.scala interpreter.scala

We have included a few test cases named worldsTestX.not and their correspondeding 
outputs in worldsTest0.out. Run these programs using the following command:

scala notWorlds worldsTestX.not

worldsTest0.not - Shows basic sprouting and executing code inside a sprouted world
worldsTest1.not - Outputs a world and a world sprouted from it to show it has a 
                  reference to the parent.
worldsTest2.not - Shows sprouting off of sprouted worlds
