For Milestone 3, we experienced what turned out to be a much more difficult problem then we first
anticipated. From our original plan in Milestone 2, we thought it would make the most sense to base our
"Worlds" project off of the notC syntax. After a tedious amount of time spent trying to get the Sprout
and Commit commands to work, we realized that we were taking a slightly incorrect approach to solving the
problem. The TA informed us that we would have a much more rewarding experience if we started with notJS
as our base syntax. So after weighing out the pros and cons, we decided to abandon our work on the
interpeter and syntax which was based off of notC, and start fresh with notJS. We hope that this change
will be a huge benefit as we come across more complicated aspects of completing this project. That being
said, the current state of our project at Milestone 3 is that we have completed the syntax for the Sprout
and Commit commands. Our intepreter is currently in the stage of implementings Sprout, and we hope to
complete this very soon since switching to notJS as our syntax base. From there, we plan on completing
the Commit command in time for Milestone 4.
